# CAPSTONE PROJECT
Retail Sales Forecast &amp; Recommendations for a departmental store
Domain
This project is to predict the sales across different stores. The data containing historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Within the Excel Sheet, there are 3 Tabs â€“ Stores, Features and Sales

### Skills and Tools
Linear Programming, Principal Component Analysis, Random Forest, TABLEAU, Ensemble

## Conclusion

1. Increase in stores size by 50% will generate 20% more sales. Increase beyond 50% shown no evidence of more sales. 
2. For stores where size increase is not possible, increase Markdown3 by 10% for 20% increase in sales. 50% increase can get sales up by 22% but cost of Markdown should be factored in. Increase beyond 50% shown no signs of sales improvement. 
3. Increase in both Store Size and Markdown may not be viable as the sales may grow not more than 20%

## 1. Cardio Fitness Analysis Using R
Cardio fitness data of about 180 people were provided using various cardio fitness products. The objective was to study and analyze which of the products is 	effective in terms of fitness and usage. The project involved interpretation of statistical output to generate managerial recommendations, using regression as a prediction device and most importantly evaluating and choosing of alternative statistical models.

### Skills and Tools
Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis, Missing Value Treatment


## 2. Evaluated the impact of a new golf ball coating

This project used Hypothesis Testing and visualization to evaluate a new golf ball coating designed to resist cuts and provide durability by comparing the driving distances of the old and new golf ball.

### Skills and Tools
Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Inference, Analytics

## 3. Regression Model on Market Segmentation

This project identified the factors to study satisfaction level of customer. A regression model to be built using these factors for Market segmentation.The objective of the project is to use the dataset to build a regression model to predict customer satisfaction.

### Skills and Tools
Correlation, Regression, Multicollinearity, PCA/FA

## 4. Classification Model to predict response of new customers

The data-set provides details from My Bank about a Personal Loan Campaign that was executed by the bank., The data needs to be used to create classification model(s) in order to predict the response of new set of customers in the future, depending on the attributes available in the data.

### Skills and Tools

## 5. Choosing preferable mode of transport by employees

The project involves deciding on the mode of transport that the employees prefer while commuting to office. For this, multiple models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression have been created and explored to check their model performance metrics. Bagging and Boosting modeling procedures have also been applied to create the models.

### Skills and Tools
KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Bagging and Boosting

## 6. Visualizing Insurance Claims using Tableau

This project explored the art of problem solving with the aid of visual analytics. The Data visualization tools in Tableau were used to create interactive dashboards to provide high level insights to the CEO of an Insurance company in order to drive the company's policy making process.

### Skills and Tools
